        The meta-package _{{ family }}-microarch-level enforces the microarchitecture in the
        user system.

        Note that a user would need the archspec conda package installed
        in the base environment where conda/mamba is run from.
        Note also that this package is not intended to be directly interacted
        with by users.

        See {{ family }}-microarch-level for using this in conda recipes

        Use the meta-package {{ family }}-microarch-level in requirements/build in conda
        recipes to set up the compiler flags and set up the virtual package
        requirements in the run requirements.

        When building packages on CI, level=4 will not be guaranteed, so
        you can only use level<=3 to build.

        The run_exports only has a lower bound and therefore a level=2
        build can be installed on a level=3 user system. A tighter bound
        is not added because we want to be able to test both level=2 and
        level=3 on a CI machine with level=3.
        Therefore in order to prioritise the highest level, use the build
        number to prioritise the level.

        In [rare circumstances](https://github.com/conda-forge/microarch-level-feedstock/issues/13#issuecomment-2551385113)
        where a particular level needs to be forced, this can be achieved by
        overriding the `__archspec`
        [virtual package](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/tasks/manage-virtual.html)
        by setting the `CONDA_OVERRIDE_ARCHSPEC` environment variable during
        the environment solve.
        For example, setting `CONDA_OVERRIDE_ARCHSPEC=x86_64` will force
        level=1. For levels higher than 1 `CONDA_OVERRIDE_ARCHSPEC=x86_64_vx`
        will force level=x. For example, `CONDA_OVERRIDE_ARCHSPEC=x86_64_v2`
        will force level=2.
        Note that no checks will be done to ensure that the level is viable.

        Only supported on Linux and macOS.
